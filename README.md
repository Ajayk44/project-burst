# Project Burst
 The Google Meet for Chat. 

## Main Idea
### Feature No. 1
Create temporary group chats that are secure and can be shared as link instead of through phone number/ social handles. Group chats will be automatically gone after set time. Archive for chat creator. Basically Google meet for chat. 

Following the same process to initiate, admin and end as google meet does - create link, admit a person, remove, end chat (chat admin can get a archived copy of chat for ref)

Motivation is that we create groups for events that die out after they end. These groups stay cluttered on our chat apps. I wanna help people create temporary chat spaces for their talks, plans, events and anything imaginable. 

## Chat Inbox
### Feature No. 2
Another feature on my mind is chat inbox. So many times we just want to have a public interface while also feeling virtually comfortable. Maybe we don’t yet wanna accept a person into our private Instagram yet but wanna talk to them. 

Or also maybe you just want people to drop texts for you and you would have an inbox. You choose to reply or not. Just like mail. 

Create your own chat inbox for that and share it with the world.

(Different from all those anonymous chat link platforms is I want people to be have the ease of chat but like the functionality like of mail, so can be used for professional chats too.)
